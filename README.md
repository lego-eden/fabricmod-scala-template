# A template for creating a minecraft mod using Scala
This repository contains a skeleton for creating Minecraft mods
with scala instead of Java or Kotlin. This project utilizes a
fork of the official [fabric language scala](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-language-scala) mod, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Krysztal112233/krysztal-language-scala). The original mod is
unmaintained, but if it ever gets updated this project will
implement that one instead.
